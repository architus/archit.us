---

Auto responses allow users to configure architus to listen for and respond to message patterns using an extensive syntax explained below.

<Alert type="info">

**Note:** examples use the `!` command prefix but this may vary by server

</Alert>

## Setting Auto Responses

`!set <trigger>::<response>`

architus will respond with `<response>` when `<trigger>` is sent in a text channel.

![setting](./set_demo.png)

## Removing Auto Responses

Auto responses may be removed from within the discord client via the `remove` command.

`!remove <trigger>`

The trigger must exactly match the original trigger used to set the auto response. If you are unsure of the original trigger, you may react with the [info reaction](/features/auto-responses/#info-reaction) on the response message to find it. Alternatively, the [web dashboard](https://archit.us/app) provides an interface for viewing and filtering auto responses in your servers.

## Info Reaction

As a way to mitigate potential confusion and annoyance stemming from the auto response system, architus provides a way to easily identify the source of automatically triggered messages: you may react with a ðŸ’¬ (`:speech_balloon:`) to view the exact syntax and author of the auto response.

## Response Substitutions

responses set on architus may include any number of special tokens which will be substituted with a special value when the response is triggered.

#### \[author\]

substituted with the name of the user that triggered the auto response

![author](./author_demo.png)

#### \[noun\], \[adj\], and \[adv\]

substituted with a random noun, adjective, or adverb, respectively

![words](./words_demo.png)

#### \[count\]

substituted with the number of times the auto response has been triggered

![count](./count_demo.png)

#### \[member\]

substituted with the name of a random member of the server

![member](./member_demo.png)

#### \[:emoji:\]

not rendered in the response, but instead architus will react to the trigger message with the specified emoji

![react](./react_demo.png)

#### \[option 1, option 2, option 3\]

substituted with one of the options. The options are seperated by commas.

![list](./list_demo.png)

#### \[0\], \[1\], \[2\], ...

substituted with the [captured text](/features/auto-responses/#capture-groups) taken from the trigger message.

![capture](./capture_demo.png)

### Errors

If architus is unable to parse your response, it will display an error along with the position of the character that confused it.

<Alert type="info">

**Tip:** If you are trying to use unmatched `[]`s, try escaping with a backslash `\`

</Alert>


## Trigger Punctuation & Whitespace

#### Punctuation

Basic text only triggers will not take punctuation into account. Triggers that include punctuation will take into account _only_ the punctuation characters used in the trigger.

For example, for the response `how are you::I'm good`, architus will respond `I'm good` to both `how are you` and `how are you?`.

Conversely, with `!roll d4::[1,2,3,4]`, architus will pick a number for `!roll d4` and _not_ for `roll d4`.

#### Whitespace

Whitespace in triggers is always matched literally. This differs from previous versions in which it was ignored.

<Alert type="info">

**Note:** for advanced handling of punctuation and whitespace, consider using [regex triggers](/features/auto-responses/#regex-triggers).
</Alert>

## Regex Triggers

Regexes or regular exressions are a standard language for matching patterns of strings. Regex triggers allow you to program architus to respond to patterns in messages rather than word-for-word phrases. They also allow capturing content from the trigger message to be used in the response.
<Alert type="info">

**Note:** Regex Triggers do not make any automatic adjustments to punctuation matching.
</Alert>

#### Setting a Regex Trigger

To set a regex trigger, ensure that your trigger begins with `^` and ends with `$`.

**e.g.** `!set ^test$::hi`

#### Common Syntax

Regular expressions are complex and the reader would be better served learning them elsewhere, but here is a short reference of common patterns that architus supports

###### Expressions

| Pattern  | Description                                    |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `.`      | matches any character                          |
| `[xyz]`  | matches `x`, `y`, or `z`                       |
| `[^xyz]` | matches any character except `x`, `y`, and `z` |
| `x`\|`y` | `x` or `y` (prefer `x`)                        |
| `x*`     | zero or more `x`, prefer more                  |
| `x+`     | one or more `x`, prefer more                   |
| `x?`     | zero or one `x`, prefer one                    |
| `x{n,m}` | `n` or `n+1` or ... or `m` `x`, prefer more    |
| `x{n,}`  | `n` or more `x`, prefer more                   |
| `x{n}`   | exactly `n` `x`                                |
| `(re)`   | numbered capturing group (submatch)            |
| `\d`     | digits (â‰¡ `[0-9]`)                             |
| `\s`     | whitespace (â‰¡ `[\t\n\f\r ]`)                   |
| `\w`     | word characters (â‰¡ `[0-9A-Za-z_]`)             |

#### Capture Groups

When a trigger regex that contains capturing groups is matched, the captured content can be used in the response via the [response syntax](/features/auto-responses/#0-1-2-)

`!set ^should I (.+) or (.+)$::I think you should [[0], [1]]`

#### Wildcard (`*`)

Older users might be familiar with using `*` as a 'wildcard' to capture anything in the trigger. That syntax has been deprecated in favor of the much more powerful regex language. Below are a few examples of how one may accomplish the same things with the new system.

###### Comparison

| old                                       | new (exactly)                                 | new (better)                                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `!set no*u::no no [capture]u`             | `!set ^no (.*)u$::no no [0]u`                 | `!set ^((no )+)u$::no [0]u`                             |
| `!set https://www.facebook.com/*::ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚` | `!set ^https://www\.facebook\.com/.*::ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚` | `!set ^https://(www\.)?facebook\.com/[\w/=?]+$::ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚` |
| `!set !ban *::ðŸ”¨ banned [capture] ðŸ”¨`     | `!set ^!ban (.*)$::ðŸ”¨ banned [0] ðŸ”¨`          | `!set ^!ban (<@!\d+>)$::ðŸ”¨ banned [0] ðŸ”¨`               |

<Alert type="info">

Generally speaking, if you are not interested in learning the intricacies of the regex system, replace the old `*` with `(.*)` and the old `[capture]` with `[0]`.
</Alert>

### Errors

In the event that architus is unable to parse your trigger regex, it will give an error message along with a number indicating the position (after the `^` and starting at 0) of the error.

<Alert type="error">

Non-admin users will not be able to set regex triggers unless they are allowed in `settings`
</Alert>

## Settings

The auto response settings pane can be accessed by the `settings responses` command
