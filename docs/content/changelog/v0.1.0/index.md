* `settings` allows you to change the prefix Architus uses on a server basis
* `settings` allows you to set a per-member limit to the number of auto responses that are allowed
* Architus willl fill a channel named `#lfs-posts` with 4k+ NA overwatch scrim listings

### API
* https://api.archit.us/stats/<guild_id> - returns statistics about the messages in the server
* https://api.archit.us/invite/<guild_id> - redirects to invite link
* https://api.archit.us/responses/<guild_id> - list and modify responses in the server
* https://api.archit.us/guild-count - returns the total servers and users Architus serves

See internal docs for more information

### Improvements

* Architus now supports sharding! This basically means more resources per server.
* `quote`, `gulag`, `messagecount`, `spellcheck` can be targeted using a mention, nickname, username, or id
* `poll` should be much more intuitive to use
* `messagecount` and `spellcheck` are much faster on large servers
* Images generated by Architus are stored on its own CDN
* Gulag picture is round and higher quality
* The music related commands are disabled by default if Rhythm is in the server, and can be toggled in `settings`
* Names and role mentions can now be used to register roles as joinable or default in `settings`
* `p` and `q` aliases for `play` and `queue`
* `remove` removes an autoresponse instead of the awkward `set <resp>::remove` syntax
* `gulag` and `settings` commands now edit to notify when they expire
* Major work done on the backend to support the API and future scaling

### Bugfixes

* Running `spellcheck` before `messagecount` no longer renders `messagecount` inaccurate
* Author profile pictures on the starboard are longer blank after a user changes their picture
* Misc improvements to music features
* Loading a new emoji for the first time in a new channel no longer causes Architus to Freeze
* Fix some locale issues with schedule
* Malicious users can no longer add unlimited auto responses in servers that they are not members of through the gateway

### Regressions

* The 'Is Ajax Masters? (@Ajaxbeat)' account on twitter was blocked, so this feature no longer works :/
* Removed `letmein`
* Removed `line`
* Removed `spectrum`
