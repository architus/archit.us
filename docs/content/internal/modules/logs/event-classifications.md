title: Event classifications
---

This document contains a classification of each relevant log event type (defined in the protobuf enum `logs.event.EventType`) based on what their source will be (i.e. how we will get them from Discord).

<Alert type="info">

All of the events that are classified as "Audit log, with special in certain cases" are all classified as such for the same reason, but I forgot what it is. ðŸ™‚. Don't worry about it for now.
