This folder contains implementation documentation for the architus ecosystem, including the microservice-based backend application as well as the React-based web dashboard. The entire site was built in Gatsby.js, React, and MDX, and the source can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/architus/docs.archit.us).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Setup

To set up the docs.archit.us website locally, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. Once installed, run the following commands to download dependencies:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
yarn install
```

## üìù Authoring Documentation

To edit documentation or add new pages, add `.md` files to the `docs/` folder in the repository root. Any files automatically result in generated pages at the same public path as their relative path, starting from the `docs/` folder. To add a page with the same name/path as a subdirectory, simply add a file named `index.md`.

More information is available on authoring at the [docs page for it](/internal/community/authoring).

### File Format

```md
---
title: (Required). Name that appears in the title <h1> and in the side NavBar
shortTitle: (Optional; defaults to title). Name that appears in the title bar & breadcrumb
---

# Markdown content

```

## üì° Development Server

Similar to the frontend web dashboard, there are two options to preview the app while developing: a **hot reload-enabled development server** _(recommended)_ and a **statically-generated site preview**.

### Hot-reload-enabled

```bash
yarn start
```

### Statically-generated preview

```bash
yarn build
yarn serve
```

### Code Style

docs.archit.us uses [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to enforce JavaScript code style across the repository. To run the linter locally, run:

```bash
yarn run lint
```
