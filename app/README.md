## üöÄ Getting Started

To use archit.us to manage the Architus bot on installed servers or add it to new ones, [connect with Discord](https://api.archit.us/session/login) to be redirected to the web dashboard, where you can view settings and add the bot to your servers.

### Setup

To set up the archit.us web application, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. Once installed, run the following commands to download dependencies:

```console
npm install -g yarn
yarn install
```

## üì° Development Server

Because the web application is built with [react-static](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static) at its core, there are two options to preview the app while developing: a **hot reload-enabled development server** *(recommended)* and a **statically-generated site preview**.

### Hot-reload-enabled

```console
yarn start
```

### Statically-generated preview

```console
yarn build
yarn serve
```

### Code Style

Archit.us uses [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to enforce JavaScript code style across the repository. To run the linter locally, run:

```console
yarn run lint
```
